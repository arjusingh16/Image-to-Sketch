Image to Sketch Converter 🎨

This project is a Python-based Image to Sketch Converter that transforms colored images into realistic pencil sketches using image processing techniques. It demonstrates basic computer vision and numerical computation concepts using OpenCV and NumPy.

🧠 Overview

The program reads an image, converts it to grayscale, inverts it, applies a Gaussian blur, and then blends it with the original grayscale image to create a pencil sketch effect. The result mimics a hand-drawn sketch and can be applied to any image.

🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Image-to-Sketch.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Image-to-Sketch

3. Run the Python script:

python pencil_sketch.py

4. The program will process the selected image and display (or save) its pencil sketch version.

🧩 How It Works

1. The image is read using OpenCV.
2. Converted to grayscale.
3. Inverted to highlight lighter areas.
4. Blurred using a Gaussian filter for smooth shading.
5. The sketch is created using a division operation (NumPy) between the grayscale and inverted blurred image.
